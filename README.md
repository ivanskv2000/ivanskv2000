ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan â€” a product analyst who cares about making data useful and builds tools that help people create better products.

By day, I work on InDriveâ€™s A/B testing platform; by night, Iâ€™m building Evsy, a tool for managing analytical events with structure and sanity.

I see analytics as a product in itself â€” one that deserves clear logic, solid patterns, and good UX.
